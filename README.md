## Assignments:

#### Basic_CSS
In this assignment we learned some basic CSS styling which allowed us to hover over an img element and change the appearance of the element.

#### Basic_HTML_and_CSS
This series of assignments are located in one folder as they are related. They are basic html files in which we learn how to use different HTML elements, and how to style using a stylesheet or inline styles.

#### Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript
This series of assignments are located in one folder as they are related. They are two instances of utilizing a script tag to link JS  files to interact with HTML files. We use a basic function, and the alert method.

#### Basic_HTML
This assignment is just a basic example of html syntax.

#### bootstrap_challenge
Utilizing bootstrap to automatically adjust the width of two collumns.

#### Challenges
These are a series of challenges given towards the end of the HTML and CSS course that range from utilizing the filter attribute in css to having text overlay a video element.

#### Creating-a-CSS-menu
Exactly what it sounds like. Using CSS we create a menu that drops down options when hovered over.

#### debugging
We were challenged to modify some html code that had several bugs so that the page displayed the same as what was originally intended.

#### Hello_World
JS file that is an introduction to Node.js. Console logging three statements helping to learn how to use the debugging tool.

#### HTML-Documents
This series of assignments are located in one folder as they are related. These assignments we created a few basic HTML pages and linked them together.

#### Media_Query
This assignment had us create a page that utilized an example of Media-Queries. If the page's width becomes smaller that 600px wide, the style of the font changes.

#### TylerWalkerDrill
This txt file was  used for a drill where I had to utilize FTP and FileZilla to upload a file to a host.

# Project Descriptions
## Space Station:
This project had us copy code from an instructional video to make a carbon copy project of a mocked up space station page. This project tested the limits of the CSS we learned  throughout the rest of the course up to that point.

## Aura Primordia | Unofficial
This project challanged us to create a one page website from scratch utilizing the lessons we had learned about CSS and HTML up to that point. I had decided to make a very limited mock up for a website for a band I previously participated in.

## Academy Cinemas
This project had us create a mock up website for a movie theatre. The reason for this project was to demonstrate the ability to utilize bootstrap for styling web pages, and being able to read and find what  is needed from the available documentation.

## Mock Portfolio
This project had us modify an existing template for a portfolio page. Optionally we could pay to have this site hosted on by GoDaddy or use our github.io page. I already have a portfolio page on my github.io, and I'm currently not looking to host a website for my portfolio, so I made the edits, but this page currently lays dormant. I will likely update my github.io to this project in the near future, but I don't beleive it to be as functional as what I currently have for the time being.
